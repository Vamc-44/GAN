# GAN
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are an exciting recent innovation in machine learning. 
GANs are generative models: they createnew data instances that resemble your training data. For example, GANs can create images that look like photographs of human faces, even thoughthe faces don't belong to any real person. 
GANs achieve this level of realism by pairing a generator, which learns to produce the target output, with a discriminator, which learns to distinguish true data from the output of the generator. The generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to keep from being fooled.

#Generative – To learn a generative model, which describes how data is generated in terms of a probabilistic model. In simple words, it explains how data is generated visually. 
#Adversarial – The training of the model is done in an adversarial setting. 
#Networks – use deep neural networks for training purposes.
